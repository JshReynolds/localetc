# POSSIBLY AMAZING ETC LOCAL CONFIGURATOR

### Why Bother? 

This repo is how I manage my local configuration.  
Essentially it's a slightly modular PATH and Environment variable
configuration system using
Shell script basics (making it usable for bash AND zsh -- I started using
Oh my Zsh! midway through.

Anyways, I liked how debian was managing ngnix site configurations and decided to use something similar
to manage units of configuration for my terminal.

##USAGE

1. Download the `install/boostrap.sh` script on your osx machine.
2. Run it.  This will generate an ssh key for you and prompt you to do the rest of the steps necessary to configure your machine just how _I_ like it.
