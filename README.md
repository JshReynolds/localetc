# POSSIBLY AMAZING ETC LOCAL CONFIGURATOR

### Why Bother? 

This repo is how I manage my local configuration.  
Essentially it's a slightly modular PATH and Environment variable
configuration system using
Shell script basics (making it usable for bash AND zsh -- I started using
Oh my Zsh! midway through.

Anyways, I liked how debian was managing ngnix site configurations and decided to use something similar
to manage units of configuration for my terminal.
